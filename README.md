# Wordle Pattern Generator

Word Pattern Generator is an app that generates a pattern for the wordle game.

The main algorithm for this app was made using Replit, with minimal human interference. The interface was hand-coded.

# HOW TO USE

Visit the netlify site at https://wordle-pattern.netlify.app/. To use the app, input the current Wordle word in the "DAILY WORD" field (you will have to look it up manually), then press the square grid until you get a desired pattern. Finally, press "GENERATE", and the squares will be filled with their respective words. By pressing the "STRICT" button, you can toggle between strict or loose search; with loose search, green and yellow squares count as just "filled".
